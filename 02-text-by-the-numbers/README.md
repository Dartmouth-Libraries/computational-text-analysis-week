# Text by the Numbers: Text Analysis Methods in Python

## Objectives
- Participants will be able to identify and explain some essential elements for translating raw text files into datasets that may be analyzed and compared computationally
- Participants will be able to transform a set of raw texts into a dataframe of word vectors ready for analysis; they will also be able to do some basic analysis of these vectors
