# Intro to Python for Text Analysis

Join us for an experiential workshop on the fundamentals of data and text analysis in Python. No prior experience required. Youâ€™ll be immersed in hands-on activities that make Python come alive, equipping you with the essential skills needed for the analysis of quantitative and textual data alike. Learn how to store, retrieve, and analyze data in a variety of formats, from numbers and text strings to lists, dictionaries, and data tables. By the end of this session, you will be able to sift through a series of text files, extract crucial data, organize it into a data table, and even create some basic visualizations from this data.

_Perfect for Python novices or those seeking a refresher, this session serves as an ideal springboard for more advanced computational text analysis sessions on Days 2 and 3. But hey, it's also a fantastic standalone course for those eager to dip their toes into the captivating realm of data and text analysis with Python._
