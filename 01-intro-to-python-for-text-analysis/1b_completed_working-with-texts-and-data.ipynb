    "\n",
    "For more on functions, we can refer to a more detailed lesson provided by [**Constellate's** Python 4 lesson](https://lab.constellate.org/perfusion-stearns-eliot/notebooks/tdm-notebooks-2023-04-03T23%3A17%3A07.601Z/python-basics-4.ipynb):\n",

    "**Functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can identify a function by the fact that it ends with a set of parentheses () where arguments can be passed into the function. Depending on the function (and your goals for using it), a function may accept no arguments, a single argument, or many arguments. For example, when we use the print() function, a string (or a variable containing a string) is passed as an argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are a convenient shorthand, like a mini-program, that makes our code more modular. We don't need to know all the details of how the print() function works in order to use it. Functions are sometimes called \"black boxes\", in that we can put an argument into the box and a return value comes out. We don't need to know the inner details of the \"black box\" to use it. (Of course, as you advance your programming skills, you may become curious about how certain functions work. And if you work with sensitive data, you may need to peer in the black box to ensure the security and accuracy of the output.)\n",

    "### Ia. Built-in functions\n",
    "\n",
    "With Python alone, a programmer can perform some basic operations using simple functions introduced in Notebook 1, such as **print()**, **len()**, **max()**, **min()**, **sorted()**. To call a built-in function, you simply write the name of the function followed by any arguments you want to pass in placed within parentheses:\n",

    "\n",
    "Before we dive deeper into more complex elements of Python, we should briefly mention the important concept of _objects_ in programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "An _object_ in this context is some sort of structure that has one or more specific _properties_, which define its _state_. An object also often defines special functions that can interact with these properties called _methods_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which properties a particular _object_ has is defined by its _class_, which you can think of as a blueprint for the object. Every object of the same class will have the same methods and properties, but the properties might have different values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every class defines an initialization method that can be used to create a new object of this class. This is called _instantiation_ of an object: The object is an instance of this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost everything in Python is (also) an object! For example, when we type the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{python}\n",
    "x = 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We are instantiating an object of the class `int`! This is not immediately obvious, because we are using a kind of short-hand by typing inthe literal value of this integer. But Python converts this short-hand into the following:\n"

    "Beyond the basic functionality provided by Python's built-in functions and methods, if we want to do more advanced or specialized things we need to install and import Python **Libraries** also known as **packages**. \n",

Adding them all to Python would create mass confusion, since many people could use the same name for functions that do different things. The solution then is that functions are stored in modules that can be imported for use. A module is a Python file (extension \".py\") that contains the definitions for the functions written in Python. These modules (individual Python files) can then be collected into even larger groups called packages and libraries. Depending on how many functions you need for the program you are writing, you may import a single module, a package of modules, or a whole library.\n",
