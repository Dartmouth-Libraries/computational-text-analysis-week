You can run Python in many ways: from a command terminal, from a script called in the command terminal, from an *Integrated Development Environment* software like PyCharm or Spyder, or from interactive notebooks like Jupyter Notebooks: speaking of which...\n",
    "+ **Jupyter Notebooks** allow you to mix code, instructions and explanations meant for humans, plots/graphs, and the output of your code all in the same document. Thus, Jupyter Notebooks are ideal for teaching and collaboration. However, running Jupyter Notebooks requires locally installing Python and all the different Python Libraries / Packages you will need for your code. Fortunately, there are no-install options for running Python on cloud environments:\n",

    "\n",
    "However, to do more advanced or specialized things we need to install and import Python **Libraries** also known as **packages**. \n",

    "A **Python library** is a collection of files (known as **modules**) that each contain **functions** to complete a set of related tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Confused?* \n",
    "\n",
    "*This can get confusing as some large libraries have multiple sub-packages each with many different modules. In other cases a library consists of a single module.* ***The important thing to know is that you need to import each library or module you want to use.***/\n",

    "Some commonly used modules are found in [Python's Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/). \n",

Depending on the function (and your goals for using it), a function may accept no arguments, a single argument, or many arguments. For example, when we use the print() function, a string (or a variable containing a string) is passed as an argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are a convenient shorthand, like a mini-program, that makes our code more modular. We don't need to know all the details of how the print() function works in order to use it. Functions are sometimes called \"black boxes\", in that we can put an argument into the box and a return value comes out. We don't need to know the inner details of the \"black box\" to use it. (Of course, as you advance your programming skills, you may become curious about how certain functions work. And if you work with sensitive data, you may need to peer in the black box to ensure the security and accuracy of the output.)\n",

    "While Python comes with many functions, there are thousands more that others have written. Adding them all to Python would create mass confusion, since many people could use the same name for functions that do different things. The solution then is that functions are stored in modules that can be imported for use. A module is a Python file (extension \".py\") that contains the definitions for the functions written in Python. These modules (individual Python files) can then be collected into even larger groups called packages and libraries. Depending on how many functions you need for the program you are writing, you may import a single module, a package of modules, or a whole library.\n",
