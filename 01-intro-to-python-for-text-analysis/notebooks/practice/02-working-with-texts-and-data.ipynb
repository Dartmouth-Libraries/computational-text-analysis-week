    "\n",
    "For more on functions, we can refer to a more detailed lesson provided by [**Constellate's** Python 4 lesson](https://lab.constellate.org/perfusion-stearns-eliot/notebooks/tdm-notebooks-2023-04-03T23%3A17%3A07.601Z/python-basics-4.ipynb):\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can identify a function by the fact that it ends with a set of parentheses () where arguments can be passed into the function. Depending on the function (and your goals for using it), a function may accept no arguments, a single argument, or many arguments. For example, when we use the print() function, a string (or a variable containing a string) is passed as an argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are a convenient shorthand, like a mini-program, that makes our code more modular. We don't need to know all the details of how the print() function works in order to use it. Functions are sometimes called \"black boxes\", in that we can put an argument into the box and a return value comes out. We don't need to know the inner details of the \"black box\" to use it. (Of course, as you advance your programming skills, you may become curious about how certain functions work. And if you work with sensitive data, you may need to peer in the black box to ensure the security and accuracy of the output.)\n",
